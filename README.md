## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization
## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

Want different decal sizes? Easy! 

**To customize decal sizes and layout:**

1. **Open `make_decals_sheet.py`** in any text editor
2. **Find the customization section** (look for `# === CUSTOMIZATION: SIZES & LAYOUT ===`)
3. **Edit the sizes list:**
   ```python
   sizes = [
       (4, 4),   # 4 mm tall, 4 rows
       (6, 5),   # 6 mm tall, 5 rows  
       (8, 4),   # 8 mm tall, 4 rows
       (12, 3),  # 12 mm tall, 3 rows
       (20, 2)   # 20 mm tall, 2 rows
   ]
   ```
4. **Adjust spacing** by changing the `gap_mm` variable

**Examples:**
- Add tiny decals: `(2, 6)` = 2mm tall, 6 rows
- Add huge decals: `(30, 1)` = 30mm tall, 1 row  
- Remove a size: Just delete that line
